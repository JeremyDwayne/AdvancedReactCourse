# AdvancedReactCourse

Code written while following the Advanced React Course by Wes Bos. 

I Highly recommend if you're experienced with creating web apps and are wanting a solid
introduction to React Concepts that expand beyond the basics. I'm coming from a
primarily Rails and Angular dominant skill set and this allowed me to connect
the more advanced topics I already know to a framework I want to be able to
work in.
